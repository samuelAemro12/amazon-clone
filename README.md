# Amazon Clone - A Full-Stack React.js Project  
A clone of Amazon, built using React, Express.js, and Firebase (for authentication), CSS Modules for styling.

## Features:
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in with Firebase.
- **Home Page**: Browse through product categories and featured products.
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about each product.
- **Cart Functionality**: Add and remove products to/from your shopping cart.
- **Order Summary**: Display a summary of selected items in the cart.
- **Payment Method**: Using Stripe for React to process real transactions (demo).

## Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, CSS Modules
- **Backend**: Express.js (instead of Firebase due to payment method limitations)
- **Authentication**: Firebase
- **API**: FakeStoreAPI (for fetching product data)
- **Deployment**: Frontend on Netlify, Backend on Render
- **Payment**: Stripe

## Description:
This is a full-stack Amazon clone built to showcase my skills in both front-end and back-end development. The site features product categories, a product details page, and a cart system. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their shopping experience.

I used React for the front end, Express.js for the backend, and Firebase for user authentication. Product data is fetched from the FakeStoreAPI. I used many intricate coding 
pracrices such as route protection, loading animation.

## Used Dependencies:
react-router-dom: Routing
react: General Library
react-dom: React rendering
firebase: User Authentication
axios: Fetching data from FakeStoreAPI
react-spinners: Loading spinners
react-responsive-carousel: Image carousel for product displays
numeral: Formatting numbers
## Status:
Public

## General Information and Acknowledgment:
This project allowed me to explore full-stack development while learning React, Express.js, and Firebase and a bit of asynchronous JavaScript. I worked on implementing user authentication, product display, and the shopping cart functionality, and fast page to page and component routing. The FakeStoreAPI provided the product data. During development, I used resources like React.js Documentation, Express.js Documentation, for learning and troubleshooting.
