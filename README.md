Description:
This is a full-stack Amazon clone built to showcase my skills in both front-end and back-end development. The site features product categories, a product details page, and a cart system. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their shopping experience.

I used React for the front end, Express.js for the backend, and Firebase for user authentication. Product data is fetched from the FakeStoreAPI.

General Information and Acknowledgment:
This project allowed me to explore full-stack development while learning React, Express.js, and Firebase. I worked on implementing user authentication, product display, and the shopping cart functionality. The FakeStoreAPI provided the product data. During development, I used resources like React.js Documentation, Express.js Documentation, and Firebase Docs for learning and troubleshooting.

Special thanks to the YouTube channels Evangadi Tech, Bro Code, and The Web School for providing explanations and tutorials.
